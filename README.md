# LucaDev's containers

A couple of opinionated containers by me

## Available Images

Each Image will be built with a `rolling` tag, along with tags specific to it's version. Available Images Below

Container | Channel | Image | Latest Tags
--- | --- | --- | ---
[bw-cli]() | latest | ghcr.io/LucaDev/bw-cli |
[wsdd2](https://github.com/LucaDev/containers/pkgs/container/wsdd2) | latest | ghcr.io/LucaDev/wsdd2 |![1.0.31](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.0.31-blue?style=flat-square) ![rolling](https://img.shields.io/badge/rolling-blue?style=flat-square)


The tooling is based off [onedr0ps](https://github.com/onedr0p/containers) excellent container repo toolchain.
