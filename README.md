# LucaDev's containers

A couple of opinionated containers by me

## Available Images

Each Image will be built with a `rolling` tag, along with tags specific to it's version. Available Images Below

Container | Channel | Image | Latest Tags
--- | --- | --- | ---
[bw-cli](https://github.com/LucaDev/containers/pkgs/container/bw-cli) | latest | ghcr.io/LucaDev/bw-cli |![2025.1.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/2025.1.2-blue?style=flat-square) ![rolling](https://img.shields.io/badge/rolling-blue?style=flat-square)


The tooling is based off [onedr0ps](https://github.com/onedr0p/containers) excellent container repo toolchain.
